# PPM & PWM Signal Generator Kit

An educational hardware kit designed and built to demonstrate the principles of Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) and Pulse Position Modulation (PPM). This project showcases analog circuit design, power supply construction, and the application of the versatile 555 Timer IC.


## Project Overview
As the team lead, I directed the end-to-end development of this fully functional, standalone kit. The project involved designing and building a stable dual-voltage power supply from scratch and implementing modulation logic using fundamental electronic components. The final kit serves as a practical tool for visualizing and understanding time-domain modulation techniques.

## Key Hardware Components & ICs
- **Power Supply:** Custom-built ±12V dual voltage power supply using a step-down transformer, bridge rectifier, and **7812/7912** linear voltage regulators.
- **Core Modulator:** The highly versatile **NE555 Timer IC**, configured in a modified astable mode.
- **Waveform Generation:** An **ICL8038** function generator to produce stable sine, square, and triangular base waveforms.
- **Signal Buffering:** Operational Amplifiers (Op-Amps) used to ensure signal stability.
- **Test Equipment:** A **RIGOL Oscilloscope** was used for testing and verifying all output waveforms.

## Concepts Demonstrated
- **Analog Circuit Design:** Designing and building circuits on a Vero board from schematic diagrams.
- **Power Electronics:** Practical implementation of AC-DC conversion, rectification, filtering, and linear voltage regulation.
- **Signal Modulation:** Hands-on application of Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) and Pulse Position Modulation (PPM).
- **Astable Multivibrators:** Using the 555 Timer IC as an oscillator to generate continuous pulse trains.
- **Waveform Generation:** Using a function generator IC to create clean input signals.
