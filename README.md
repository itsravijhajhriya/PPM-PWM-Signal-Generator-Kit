## Project Overview
As the team lead, I directed the end-to-end development of this fully functional, standalone kit. The project involved designing and building a stable dual-voltage power supply from scratch and implementing modulation logic using fundamental electronic components. The final kit serves as a practical tool for visualizing and understanding time-domain modulation techniques.

## Key Hardware Components & ICs
- **Power Supply:** Custom-built Â±12V dual voltage power supply using a step-down transformer, bridge rectifier, and **7812/7912** linear voltage regulators.
- **Core Modulator:** The highly versatile **NE555 Timer IC**, configured in a modified astable mode.
- **Waveform Generation:** An **ICL8038** function generator to produce stable sine, square, and triangular base waveforms.
- **Signal Buffering:** Operational Amplifiers (Op-Amps) used to ensure signal stability.
- **Test Equipment:** A **RIGOL Oscilloscope** was used for testing and verifying all output waveforms.

## Concepts Demonstrated
- **Analog Circuit Design:** Designing and building circuits on a Vero board from schematic diagrams.
- **Power Electronics:** Practical implementation of AC-DC conversion, rectification, filtering, and linear voltage regulation.
- **Signal Modulation:** Hands-on application of Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) and Pulse Position Modulation (PPM).
- **Astable Multivibrators:** Using the 555 Timer IC as an oscillator to generate continuous pulse trains.
- **Waveform Generation:** Using a function generator IC to create clean input signals.
